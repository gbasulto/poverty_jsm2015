<!-- Markdown is a superset of HTML, so any HTML file is valid Markdown, that
means we can use HTML elements in Markdown, such as the comment element, and
they won't be affected by a markdown parser. However, if you create an HTML
element in your markdown file, you cannot use markdown syntax within that
element's contents. -->

<!-- Markdown also varies in implementation from one parser to a next. This
guide will attempt to clarify when features are universal or when they are
specific to a certain parser. -->

<!-- Headers -->
<!-- You can create HTML elements <h1> through <h6> easily by prepending the
text you want to be in that element by a number of hashes (#) -->
# This is an <h1>
## This is an <h2>
### This is an <h3>
#### This is an <h4>
##### This is an <h5>
###### This is an <h6>
