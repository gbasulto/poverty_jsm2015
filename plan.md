<!-- Markdown is a superset of HTML, so any HTML file is valid Markdown, that
means we can use HTML elements in Markdown, such as the comment element, and
they won't be affected by a markdown parser. However, if you create an HTML
element in your markdown file, you cannot use markdown syntax within that
element's contents. -->

<!-- Markdown also varies in implementation from one parser to a next. This
guide will attempt to clarify when features are universal or when they are
specific to a certain parser. -->

<!-- Headers -->
<!-- You can create HTML elements <h1> through <h6> easily by prepending the
text you want to be in that element by a number of hashes (#) -->
# Description

This markdown is intended to provide ideas and make a checklist.

# Ideas

1. I was thinking that we could do an analysis at counties level. I added in Dropbox the file Eligibility2005.pdf, which has a list of counties that could be catalogued as "Rural".
2. Something else.

# Checklist

:---                              | :-----:   | ----:
Summarize information by counties | NA        | Be careful of whether the summary is a simple addition
